# Wooblay

No code tool to create DAO's and interact with them,
An ecosystem to contribute and join tasks,
Tools to assist in project development,
Task bounties for tokens,
Soulbound NFT's for governance rights,
Voting and gamification,
On-chain repository, tracking and automation view this code here (https://github.com/DAOWooblay/decentralized-api-github)

A platform to bring your project from 0 to 100, meeting new people to join your team or releasing task bounties to help build your product. All in a decentralised, on-chain way. 
We focus on all audiences, we may use web3 technology but we want all types of projects to be built on wooblay.



## Demo

## Features

1) No Code DAO Factory: Follow a simple UI/UX flow to create your own custom decentralised project, all automatically deployed, created and assigned to you.
2) Governance: A soulbound NFT to represent ownership, resulting in majority rules in all proposals
3) Tasks: On-chain tracking via Chainlink to automatically reward approved contributions made on supported API's
4) Task Bounties: Release public tasks and pay in USDC from the treasury.
5) Simple UI/UX: Follow a seamless flow to either start a project and build out your idea by being exposed to a community of people to join and collaborate on your idea, or be a contributor yourself.
6) Gamification: Earn XP for being active in the community, earning yourself payouts, higher passive income and a higher rank on the leaderboard.
7) Payment: Get paid USDC for both contributing and passively for being active in the DAO, based on your XP.
## Sponsors

Chainlink
Used to track and automate rewards for contributions by on-chaining the GitHub API. For example, a task is needed, a user contributes by making PR with their solutions, these solutions are voted on, the winning PR gets used and rewarded with USDC. This was used here https://github.com/DAOWooblay/decentralized-api-github

Base
Used as our Layer 2 solution.

## Planning Process

[Slides Presentation](https://linktodocumentation)

A heap of Miro boards were made to identify the core scope and functionalities, from crazy then simplified, then it went crazy again, then simplified....
Then we got this

## FAQ

#### Who is it for?

Anyone interested in bringing their idea to life and willing to try DAOs to do so and contributirs willing to contribute and join such projects.

#### What problem does it solve?

It can be very difficult to for one find people to build a project with, bring your idea to life and be paid at the same time. The platform allows a constant hackathon type system, allowing users to contribute to projects or create their own at their own will, making it easy through automation, decentralisation and gamification.

#### How can I get involved

Join our Discord, keep updated on the updated platform and reserve your spot to create one of the first DAOs.

#### Whats to come?

We have such a large scope of features to implement, currently the MVP is the core functionality but in later days we want to integrate cutting-edge technology and extend the interactivity and automation of a DAO, this is through adding to our core functionaliites and introducing ones we have planned for the future such as DAO AI and XP systems.
